  abstract = { The software gap - the discrepancy between the need for new software and the aggregat
e capacity of the workforce to produce it - is a serious problem for scientific software. Although u
sers appreciate the convenience (and, thus, improved productivity) of using relatively high-level sc
ripting languages, the slow execution speeds of these languages remain a problem. Lower level langua
ges, such as C and Fortran, provide better performance for production applications, but at the cost
of tedious programming and optimization by experts. If applications written in scripting languages c
ould be routinely compiled into highly optimized machine code, a huge productivity advantage would b
e possible. It is not enough, however, to simply develop excellent compiler technologies for scripti
ng languages (as a number of projects have succeeded in doing for MATLAB). In practice, scientists t
ypically extend these languages with their own domain-centric components, such as the MATLAB signal
processing toolbox. Doing so effectively defines a new domain-specific language. If we are to addres
s efficiency problems for such extended languages, we must develop a framework for automatically gen
erating optimizing compilers for them. To accomplish this goal, we have been pursuing an innovative
strategy that we call telescoping languages. Our approach calls for using a library-preprocessing ph
ase to extensively analyze and optimize collections of libraries that define an extended language. R
esults of this analysis are collected into annotated libraries and used to generate a library-aware
optimizer. The generated library-aware optimizer uses the knowledge gathered during preprocessing to
 carry out fast and effective optimization of high-level scripts. This enables script optimization t
o benefit from the intense analysis performed during preprocessing without repaying its price. Since
 library preprocessing is performed only at infrequent "language-generation" times, its cost is amor
tized over many compilations of individual scripts that use the library. We call this strategy "tele
scoping languages" because it merges knowledge of a hierarchy of extended languages into a single li
brary-aware optimizer. We present our vision and plans for compiler frameworks based on telescoping
languages and - report on the preliminary research that has established the effectiveness of this ap
proach. },
