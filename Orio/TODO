- clean up testsuite; add more examples of generated code
- add an option to enable "best" time to return a list instead of a single value, e.g., 
  the list ot best times within epsilon of each other, or the top 5%, etc.
- in batch systems, submit all jobs and then process results (currently it's one 
  job at a time).  -- Boyana
- make python modules for different batch queue systems, starting with Cobalt -- Boyana
- come up with some way to allow num. repetitions to be related to problem sizes
- allow input parameter ranges and specialization of tuned version based on current
  parameter values, e.g., if m < 10 use one tuned version, else use another.
- allow user to specify dynamic allocation for arrays
- allow user to specify initialization functions for arrays and other input variables
- add max. number of processors parameter to the spec
- create setup.py for installing in standard python locations (Boyana)

- integrate Pluto (polyhedral-based source-to-source transformation tool) into the 
  annotations tool -- Albert
- rewrite the Loop module's parser with ZestyParser implementation, to avoid implementing
  a complete grammar for Python expression -- Albert
- allow user to insert additional preprocessor directives -- Albert
