This folder contains files used by the ML605 SDI demos. These files are either for
modules that interface with and control devices on the Broadcast Connectivity
FMC mezzanine board or that control the LCD on the ML605. All of the files in
this folder should be added to the ISE project as source files when rebuilding
either of the ML605 SDI demos.
